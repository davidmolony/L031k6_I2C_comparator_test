# L031k6_I2C_comparator_test
Repo for trying out STM32 HAL library with MCP3424 ADC, MC9808 temperature sensor and maybe comparator

This is a repository for me (David) to share with some friends who help me with code stuff. I'm merely learning because I like to.

If you're dumb enough to use this commercially, I wish you all the luck in the world and accept zero responsibility for anything that results.
